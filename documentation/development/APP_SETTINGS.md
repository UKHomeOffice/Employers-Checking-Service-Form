# Application Settings

###Views

The application is configured to look in `./apps/common/views` for views, which is the location of the partial views and more general applicaiton views, such as `terms.html`. The "sub-app"<sup>*</sup> -specific views are compartmentalised within the "sub-app" directories.

<sup>*</sup>The term sub-app is used to describe a directory and its components within `apps`, such as `./apps/collection`, but not including `./apps/common`.
